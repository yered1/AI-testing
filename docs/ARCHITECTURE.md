# AI-Testing Platform Architecture

## System Overview

The AI-Testing Platform is a distributed security testing orchestration system that coordinates multiple specialized testing agents to perform comprehensive security assessments.

## Core Components

### 1. Orchestrator
- Central API service (FastAPI/Python)
- Manages test workflows
- Coordinates agent activities
- Handles result aggregation

### 2. Database (PostgreSQL)
- Stores engagements, plans, runs
- Manages findings and reports
- Handles multi-tenancy

### 3. Cache (Redis)
- Job queue management
- Session storage
- Real-time event streaming

### 4. Policy Engine (OPA)
- RBAC enforcement
- Resource access control
- Security policy validation

### 5. Testing Agents
- ZAP: Web application scanning
- Nuclei: Vulnerability detection
- Semgrep: Code analysis
- Nmap: Network discovery
- Kali: Advanced tools

## Data Flow

1. User creates engagement via API/UI
2. Orchestrator generates test plan
3. Jobs distributed to agents
4. Agents execute tests
5. Results aggregated
6. Reports generated

## Security Model

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Tenant isolation
- Audit logging
- Encrypted storage
