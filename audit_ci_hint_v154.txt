CI hints:
- ModuleNotFoundError: 'orchestrator' during Alembic -> set PYTHONPATH=/app and run in -w /app; use -c orchestrator/alembic.ini
- Ensure migration uses --no-deps so it doesn't pull opa/db again
- Always include OPA compat override on compose commands
- Provide DB env override so orchestrator and alembic use same credentials
